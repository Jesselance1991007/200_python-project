# 📘 Project 2: Simple Calculator

## 📖 Description
This project introduces the idea of **user input**, **variables**, and **basic arithmetic operations** in Python.  
You will build a calculator that takes two numbers from the user and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- **Variables**: Used to store values like numbers.  
- **Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` for arithmetic operations.  
- **`input()` function**: Used to collect data from the user.  
- **Type conversion**: Converting input (which is a string) into numbers using `int()` or `float()`.

## 🛠️ Steps to Build
1. Ask the user for two numbers using the `input()` function.  
2. Convert the input into numbers using `float()` or `int()`.  
3. Use arithmetic operators to calculate the results of:  
   - Addition  
   - Subtraction  
   - Multiplication  
   - Division  
4. Display the results using `print()` with clear labels.
